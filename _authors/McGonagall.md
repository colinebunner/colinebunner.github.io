McGonagall is a cat of few talents. She brings very little to the table, constantly demanding food she never Venmos me back for, throwing litter outside of the box without any intention of cleaning it up, and making it well known when she thinks I've slept in too late on the weekend. But she is adorable and does boost office morale, so she gets to stick around.
